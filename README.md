#map_app_two
A project using Google Maps JavaScript API to design a map of San Francisco that users can log into and add places they think are interesting, and comment on other users' places.

This is a project for the Full Stack Program at [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/full-stack/). The goal for the assignment was to spend a week using the skills we've learned so far to create a web app.

I used and modified code and instructions from the [Google Maps JavaScript API Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). My understanding, from reading the [Google Developers Site Policies](https://developers.google.com/site-policies), is that we are able to use [nearly everything](https://developers.google.com/site-policies#restrictions) on the Google Developers site in our own creations, as long as we include the following attribution:

In the interest of completeness: since I'm also using a lot of their code, here is an additional attribution: I reproduced and modified the Google code from the [Google Maps JavaScript API Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) according to terms described below:

The code and instructions I used came from many different pages in the [Google Maps JavaScript API Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), so hopefully, linking to the opening page of the tutorial will satisfy the requirement that I link back to the original source page. I am very grateful to Google for the tutorial, and of course also for the opportunity to make use of the Google Maps JavaScript API! It is a dream come true to have even this simple web app, showing a few locations in San Francisco that I think are fun to visit.


A few disclaimers:
- I have only been studying at Galvanize for eight weeks, so there is a lot I still don't know. I look forward to adding features and improvements as I learn more!
